This project provides a lightweight, dependency-free utility for evaluating whether LLM or RAG-generated answers are properly grounded in their retrieved context. 
It analyzes token overlap to compute grounding scores and highlight unsupported answer segments, making it useful for debugging hallucinations, validating prompts, and monitoring grounding quality in AI pipelines.

The RAG Grounding Checker Utility is a lightweight evaluation tool designed to assess how well a generated answer is grounded in its retrieved context. 
Rather than performing retrieval or text generation itself, the utility focuses purely on grounding evaluation, measuring whether an answer is supported by the provided context. 
It computes a grounding score between 0 and 1 based on token overlap, highlights unsupported tokens, and can aggregate scores across multiple samples—making it a practical diagnostic layer for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM pipelines.

Built to be fast, deterministic, and dependency-free, the tool can be used as a standalone CLI, integrated as a Python module, or embedded as a post-processing step in larger AI workflows. 
Typical use cases include detecting hallucinations, comparing prompt variants, running regression tests, and performing offline evaluations of generated datasets. 
While it intentionally avoids semantic reasoning and factual verification, this simplicity makes the utility reliable and easy to adopt for developers who want a clear, transparent signal of grounding quality without additional overhead.
