This project builds a local Flask application that streams live air-quality data from the OpenAQ API and visualizes real-time updates in the browser.

---

A real-time web application built with Flask that consumes live air-quality measurements from the OpenAQ API. The backend continuously fetches updated data and exposes it to the client using WebSockets, enabling seamless live updates without page refreshes.

Flask-SocketIO and Eventlet handle real-time communication, while Chart.js and D3.js power interactive, dynamic visualizations in the browser. Together, these tools demonstrate how to build responsive data dashboards with streaming APIs and event-driven architectures.

Designed to run locally, the app provides a clear and practical example of integrating live external APIs with Python backends and modern JavaScript visualization libraries.
