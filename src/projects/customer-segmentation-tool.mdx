This project segments customers using K-Means clustering and PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
It generates synthetic customer data, runs clustering, and shows results as an interactive scatter plot using Plotly.

---

## Features

- Generate sample customer data
- Perform K-Means clustering
- Apply PCA for 2D visualization
- Create interactive Plotly scatter plots
- Includes a Jupyter notebook for exploration

---

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or later

Install dependencies using:
````pip install -r requirements.txt````

---

## How to Run

From the main project folder, run:
````python -m src.main --clusters 5````

### This will:

1. Generate synthetic data
2. Perform clustering
3. Apply PCA
4. Save the plot to: ````data/customer_clusters_5.html````

Open that HTML file in your browser to view the interactive chart.

---

## Jupyter Notebook

To explore the dataset and clustering visually:
````jupyter notebook notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb````

---

## Running Tests

To verify everything works, run:
````python -m unittest discover -s tests````

Notes

This is a simple learning project for practicing Python programming, data generation, and K-Means clustering.
It is meant for beginners who want to understand the basics of data analysis and visualization.
