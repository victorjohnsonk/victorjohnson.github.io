This project is a simple yet flexible reminder utility built in Python that delivers desktop notifications at configurable intervals. 
Designed for developers who prefer configuration over UI, it helps enforce healthy habits like drinking water, taking breaks, or any custom reminder defined in a JSON file.

RemindMe was created to solve a common problem faced in IT roles: forgetting basic self-care during long work hours. 
Instead of building a full user interface, the project embraces a minimal, configuration-driven approach where all reminder settings—intervals, active time windows, and weekday filters—are managed through a single JSON file. 
This makes the tool fast to set up, easy to customize, and simple to extend with new reminder types.

Built as a lightweight Python script, RemindMe uses desktop notifications to gently prompt users throughout the day. 
It can be configured to run automatically at system startup, making it a hands-off companion once set up. 
While tested on Windows, the design remains portable and beginner-friendly, making it a practical learning project for Python scripting, system automation, and productivity tooling.
